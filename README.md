Hi, Iâ€™m Lucas!ðŸ‘‹ \
Iâ€™m interested in various Data Science/Engineering topics and mostly coding in Python and R.\
I've done projects on Predictive ML, NLP, Descriptive Analytics (dashboarding) etc. in various domains. Through my job, I'm currently focussing on public health related topics.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a M. Sc. degree in Business Intelligence at the Berlin School of Economics and Law and I'm working in Data Science at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel.ðŸŒ±
