Hi, I’m Lucas (-: \
I’m interested in various Data Science/Engineering topics and mostly coding in Python and R.\
I've done projects on Predictive ML, NLP, Descriptive Analytics (dashboarding) etc. in various domains. Through my job, I'm focussing on product analytics and business experimentation at the moment.

I’m currently pursuing a M.Sc. degree in Business Intelligence at the Berlin School of Economics and Law and I'm working in Analytics Engineering at Knowunity.
